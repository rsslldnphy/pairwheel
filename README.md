# Pairwheel

Utility for assigning pair-programming pairs within a team, assuming they rotate in a round-robin fashion each day.

Mainly built as an exercise for trying out Elm for the first time.

It would be nice to add a random shuffle to this, but this seems like a bit of a pain to do in Elm at the moment. May consider adding it at some point.
